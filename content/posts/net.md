> To me, social tools exist to facilitate communication with my friends,
> and perhaps expansion of my friend group to others which have the same

> centralized platforms like Dreamwidth and Discord.

> Microblogging forces you to shout at people, while IRC (now for the
> most part Discord) facilitates thoughtful conversation. Social photo
> sharing encourages the editing of photographs to make people appear [^1]
> more attractive for additional likes, while posting photos of yourself
> to your blog removes that dopamine loop and lets you just focus on
> living and occasionally documenting your life.
