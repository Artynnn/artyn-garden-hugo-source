This is me experimenting with having many posts in one org file. Is it better? What are the pros and cons?.


## Emacs <span class="tag"><span class="_emacs">@emacs</span></span> {#emacs}

All posts in here will have the category set to _emacs_.


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> Email with Notmuch {#email-with-notmuch}


#### First heading within the post {#first-heading-within-the-post}


### <span class="org-todo todo TODO">TODO</span> How I post to Lemmy with Emacs (very convoluted) {#how-post-to-lemmy-with-emacs}
