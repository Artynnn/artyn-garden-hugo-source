This is a updating list of games I beat (note not just games I played) a long with some short thoughts on them.

I don't find numeric ratings helpful so I don't do them. And I am not listing every game I ever beat, just recent ones.


## 2021 {#2021}

Overall the year had me playing total classics. Other then Swords and Sandals, I would recommended all of these games. The one that blew me away was Pikmin.

1.  **Faxanandu (NES)**: I beat this game with a guide ([Strategywiki guide](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Faxanadu) was very well developed) and I think that greatly enhanced the experience. A very enjoyable action RPG.

2.  **Flintstones: the Rescue of Dino and Hoppy (NES)**: Extremly enjoyable platformer, one of Taito's late release NES game. I find the game extremly brutal in the beginning but it gets easier once you get used to it. I like how varied the levels are in this game. Definitely one of my favorite NES games.

3.  **Flintstones: The Surprise at Dinosuar Peak (SNES)**: Extremly late NES game that is a sequal to the former game. Really good and a well-deserved sequel. It uses the same game engine but adds new mechanics like character switching (you can play as Barney now and he has a different attack).

4.  **Spore (PC)**: I remember really being excited to play this game when it came out but never got to. I beat it in less then a week. No stage took more then 2 hours (and 2 hours is really pushing it). I beat this game with a guide and once you know the tricks (which can be summarized in a sentence) this game is a breeze. I was personally shocked how short this game was,

    I still like the game, but I am glad I didn't buy it when it came out. It seems like a really good game for challenges.

5.  **Link to the Past (NES)**

6.  **Castle of Illusion (Genesis/Mega Drive)**

7.  **Pikmin (GC)**

8.  **Swords and Sandals 1, 2 and 3 (Web, Flash)**

9.  **Kirby and the crystal shards (N64)**

10. **Mario 64 (N64)**: Got all 120 Stars.


## 2022 {#2022}

1.  **EVO: Search for Eden (SNES)**: I have heard this game mentioned in regards to Spore, some see it as a spiritual pioneer. And I see the Spore similarities right away. The game is very weird and unlike most SNES games I have played.

    It is fun but there are flaws. I really wish this game a sequel and became a staple Enix franchise.

2.  **Mario Kart Doube Dash (GC)**: If you win every Cup in Mario kart on all difficulty levels and unlock everything, I consider that completion.
