This is a mirror of my Mastodon toots (which are just messages). I am currently using the [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/) instance.

I might add statistics here in the future. This is sort of modeled after [Stallman's political notes](https://www.stallman.org/archives/2022-jan-apr.html).

    "As a power cyclist, you have to match the voltage (V) and the current (A) of the device you are powering or charging. However, this is easier said than done."

    You have to bike harder depending on the task.

    This was by far the best website I have read on Richard Wagner. I really liked it since it doesn't sugercoat and is informative. it tells exactly what he did, what he wrote and what people thought about him. And with zero bloat.

    Stork search is by far the best static site search I have tried. Incorporated it into my Hugo site.
