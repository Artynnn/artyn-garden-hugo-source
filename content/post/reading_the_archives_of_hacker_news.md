I want to better understand Tech trends, fashion and our chaining times. So I have endeavored to read Hacker News top 30 (including comments if I can) from 2007 (first public release) to maybe 2013-2015 (when things start to feel very familiar).

I think the easiest way to follow along is just to go through the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101183713/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74452), I find their in-house archive interface to be rather strange.

If you were a programmer back in 2007 all these things are familar to you but if your younger it is quite interesting. A lot has happened that you might have forgot.

This post should not be shared until I finish it. This is a evolving document.

I will probably do one on slashdot as well.


## 2007 {#2007}


### Things I learned: {#things-i-learned}

-   Django and Ruby on Rails discussed as hot topics. Dealing with users on IE6 (released in 2001) also.

-   Iphone launch big and was seen as a major invention even before launch (much like Gmail). It was already seen as pivotal.

-   Way more Ruby content. Ruby seen in a quite postive light. I usually see Ruby nowadays denigrated or see as a "fallen angel" of sort.

-   Vista hate (I think OS X Leopard was objectively better).

-   ATOM RFC gets published. Which was probably the last major event for XML syndication technology (other then the collapse of Google Reader).

-   Web 2.0 is a big meme. Flash games are made to satirize it. Also some good quotes on it like "you make all the content. they keep all the revenue". ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20070703005344/http://bash.org/?779320))

-   MySpace really was big (MySpace [millionare](https://web.archive.org/web/20070830032617/http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/118/girl-power.html)). Some [people were totally wrong](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011100845/http://mattmaroon.com/?p=280) ([another one of their posts](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011035848/http://mattmaroon.com/?p=277)). It seems Facebook vs MySpace was the big battle of 2007.

-   Learned about Jaiku, Twitter's original rival, though I don't really understand what it made it different or fail. They had Google support unlike Twitter. According to [failory](https://www.failory.com/google/jaiku) it was another "killed by Google story":

    > In the months following the acquisition, users encountered multiple issues. The site was often down or slow to load. It took hours for the information to sync, and third-party applications had troubles working with the site as well. All of this led to many existing users migrating to Twitter. The fact that new users couldn’t join for a while without an invitation from Google didn’t help matters.
    >
    > Google’s attitude towards the tool didn’t improve much in the following years, and Jaiku never got any new features.

-   Big blogs I see:
    -   Steve Yegge: Languished into obscurity.

    -   [Joel Spolsky](http://www.oilshell.org/blog/2021/07/spolsky.html): Whos basically been memorialized due to the success of stack overflow.

    -   Aaron Swartz (RIP)

    -   Paul Graham (only one still around?)

-   Intersting post on [the web stack of nine of the largest websites in the world.](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012202049/http://royal.pingdom.com/?p=173) Totally different landscape today. Notably no Nginx, Ruby, Node, Postgres to name only a few.

-   Some interesting articles:
    -   [Wordpress comment system built with Yahoo UI](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011215346/http://jackslocum.com/blog/2006/10/09/my-wordpress-comments-system-built-with-yahoo-ui-and-yahooext/)
    -   [finding good programmers](https://web.archive.org/web/20071011010054/http://www.lightsphere.com/blog/programming/finding_good_programmers.html)
    -   [cmdrtaco is right](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012013917/http://reddit.blogspot.com/2007/10/cmdrtaco-may-have-point.html)
    -   [some blogs are very profitable](https://web.archive.org/web/20071022123117/http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/10/21/BUVJSNSTC.DTL) (rookie numbers now in the substack era)

-   [Universal being a piece of shit](https://web.archive.org/web/20071022094644/http://imslp.org/), shutdown a website for public domain music.

-   We see the beginning of the networking meme (that success only comes from who you know).
    -   what [Reddit taught me about startups](https://web.archive.org/web/20071024012326/http://reddit.blogspot.com/2007/10/what-reddit-taught-me-about-startups_22.html).

    -   [Take a Cookie](https://web.archive.org/web/20071014011343/http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2004/09/always_take_a_c.html).

-   [Interesting thoughts on C](https://web.archive.org/web/20071025082302/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=71967) vs "Haskell/Lisp/Erlang hipsters".

-   [Languages: worst cases vs average](https://web.archive.org/web/20071012030231/http://journal.dedasys.com/articles/2007/10/09/languages-worst-case-vs-average)

-   Disqus is launched

-   [Diggs future seemed certain](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101184202/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74714)

-   [humor](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101215005/http://kirubakaran.blogspot.com/2007/10/pros.html), kinda stupid.


### Meta (Hacker News itself) {#meta--hacker-news-itself}

-   Way more Lisp content (also some people I recognize from Lisp like Kaashif), there will be atleast 1 or 2 lisp stories on the front page (and many times it is the most commented piece). I think it is the most popular language discussed? I find it so weird, Lisp now is relegated to obscurity, rarely ever see it on the front page now&nbsp;[^fn:1].

-   Very few comments: more like [lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) numbers (though with way less depth). I think techcrunch and slashdot are bigger at this time?

-   Points / Karma were public.

-   Typepad and Blogspot are big blogging platforms, constantly see it. No static site generators, all CMS, Jekyll will be released in due time and start a revolution.

-   Paul Graham wasn't worshipped? Though the cult seems to be developing. He utterly dominates as the top story, eclipsing everything. It is interesting how people directly talked to him.

-   Generally feels way less political, the social climate.

-   Way more Wired Magazine, I rarely see it these days.

-   A lot of junk science articles, perennials I guess.

-   [Music thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20100317205409/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=61831), they like downtempo, classical and ambient. Interesting to see the difference between Music taste of HN in 2007 vs more contemporary ([2019](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19579216), [2020](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22096675)).

-   Talk about YC and startups dominant. Also talk of the San Francisco and Sillicon Valley.

-   Very little talk about hype languages nor mainstream tech news. just YC

-   We see the beginning of the ricing trend ([Hacker Screenshots](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101184143/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74605)). The Hacker screeshots provide us some statistics on what peoples Tech Stacks were. Intestine to me how many of the screenshots are from \*.edu websites, students still commonly had their own university web page. Some I like:
    -   [apox [Ion]​](https://web.archive.org/web/20120518053458/http://www.csh.rit.edu/~apox/images/screenshots/20071031.png) (Ion WM is basically like i3 WM), you can see the Disqus announcment in that one. You usually don't see Amarok (Music Player) or iceweasel (former Firefox for Debian)

    -   [[XFCE]​](https://web.archive.org/web/20160721181930/http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/396296975_1f2e6f41a6_b.jpg), running Xnest and QEMU.

-   Overall I feel like we had tremendous improvment on people's desktop aesthetics, nearly ever post on [unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/) looks better then these "Hacker Screenshots", especially in the font department. My god were some peoples fonts choice awful ([this thread was sorely needed](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101183713/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=74452)), really appreciate the work of open source fonts creators.

-   Typical Rationalist airheads are popular (Unqualified Reservations, Aubrey De Gray, Bostrom), perennial.

-   [Email bashing has always been a perennial](https://web.archive.org/web/20071120202302/http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=81519)

### Interesting Quotes {#interesting-quotes}

Taken from top 30 articles or from the comments.

The power of MySpace:

> The MySpace press release quotes a study by Forrester that shows that “nearly 80% of 12-17 year olds use MySpace at least weekly which is three times more than any other social network. - [src](https://web.archive.org/web/20070714132325/http://gigaom.com/2007/07/11/myspace-dont-you-forget-about-me/)

> I'd say at 10 you have a good chance at an interview, at 13-15 an excellent chance. This is derived from Paul's writings, speeches, videos, and comments.
>
> The actual idea doesn't matter because Paul will either tell you he likes it or recommend changing it during the interview. If you're not done with college, now is the time to say you will focus on the project instead.
>
> Again, this is just a rough guide and I have zero qualifications to even write this. After the interview, only your execution matters.

on how Distributed Version Control (like Git and Mercurial) are perceived:

> In 2007, Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS) are all the range among the alpha-geeks. They’re thrilled with tools like git, mercurial, bazaar-ng, darcs, monotone… and they view Subversion as a dinosaur. Bleeding-edge open source projects are switching to DVCS. Many of these early adopters come off as either incredibly pretentious and self-righteous (like Linus Torvalds!), or are just obnoxious fanboys who love DVCS because it’s new and shiny. - [src](https://web.archive.org/web/20071017091856/http://blog.red-bean.com/sussman/?p=79)

Fake friends not a Facebook thing:

> I guess he uses Facebook differently from the way I do. I've met every one of my Facebook friends in person. (Although it's been a while, as my old high school classmates keep showing up.)
>
> I thought "fake" friends was more of a Myspace or Livejournal thing. - [src](https://web.archive.org/web/20071024020807/http://bnoopy.typepad.com/bnoopy/2004/09/always_take_a_c.html)

Five easy ways to have a failed company (I think it applies to most team projects):

> shitty devs + weekly milestones + Demanding that a team commit to completing its work much sooner than forecast. + overwork = **disaster**
>
> -   [src](https://web.archive.org/web/20071027023936/http://www.inc.com/magazine/20071101/how-hard-could-it-be-five-easy-ways-to-fail.html?partner=fogcreek)

[^fn:1]: Find the old course schedules for any community college near you. Almost all the ones near me had classes like "syntax and semantics of LISP", I find found this in a course schedule from 1993, not saying that this was a thing in 2007, but the flame was still there.
