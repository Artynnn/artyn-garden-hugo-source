This page documents changes to my website, in much more verbose detail.

I think its always the best to have a off git changelog where you can go in more detail and can have access to proper markup.

First I want to discuss principles that guide the design of the website.


## principles #1: progressive enhancement {#principles-1-progressive-enhancement}

I want my website to be viewable in both a text browser and on fully-featured browers, and with JavaScript enabled. I use the features that all of these things provide and take way if the user doesn't want it or can't afford to use it.
