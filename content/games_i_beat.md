This is a updating list of games I beat (note not just games I played) a long with some short thoughts on them.

I don't find numeric ratings helpful so I don't do them.


## 2021 {#2021}

-   Faxanandu (NES): I beat this game with a guide (strategywiki's guide was very well developed) and I think that greatly enhanced the experience. A very enjoyable action RPG.

-   Flintstones: The rescue of Dino and Hoppy (NES): Extremly enjoyable platformer, one of Taito's late release NES game. I find the game extremly brutal in beginning but it gets easier once you get used to it. I like how varied the levels are in this game. Definitely one of my favorite NES games.

-   Flintstones: The Surprise at Dinosuar Peak (SNES): Extremly late NES game that was equal to former game. Really good and a well-deserved sequel. It uses the same game engine it seems from the last game.
