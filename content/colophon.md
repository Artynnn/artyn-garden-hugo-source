This is about the [design of the website](https://artyns-garden.vercel.app) and the principles behind them.


## Principles {#principles}


### Progressive Enhancement {#progressive-enhancement}

This is the idea that features should be features not baseline essentials. I try to have features on this website (sidenotes, aside table of contents) but if a website doesn't support Javascript or CSS (like a text browser), this website is viewable without.
