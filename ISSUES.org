* TODO  fix backlink partial (including things that aren't backlinks)

Its due to the fact that my file names aren't based on dates, but just general words that I use in the title.

Should I include dates? I am thinking of starting the git log all over since my git history has been broken apart.

* DONE weird behavior with search

for example, I search for "emac" and I get all instances of the reference "emacs", but if I do an actualy search for "emacs", I get NOTHING. Despite the fact that "emacs" is always the one actually used. I checked the json aswell and it is always "emacs".

This is utterly strange to me.

<2022-04-13 Wed> I found a solution, I switched away from lunr.js to stork search, and this problem was fixed right away.

Stork seems better in all categories:

- smaller index file
- faster search due to WASM
- the search actually works
- simpler setup (atleast to me)
- shows highlighted sections not places where term is allegedly referenced

* Automate workflow to create site index

Could probably due this in the makefile? I have the index.toml builder in =layouts/= but I need it in =content/= after a render. So I need to somehow fix that.
