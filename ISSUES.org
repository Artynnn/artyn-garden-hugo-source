* OPEN fix backlink partial (including things that aren't backlinks)

Its due to the fact that my file names aren't based on dates, but just general words that I use in the title.

* OPEN weird behavior with search

for example, I search for "emac" and I get all instances of the reference "emacs", but if I do an actualy search for "emacs", I get NOTHING. Despite the fact that "emacs" is always the one actually used. I checked the json aswell and it is always "emacs".

This is utterly strange to me.
